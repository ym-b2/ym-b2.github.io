        <p>Order Fulfillment: During checkout, we collect information necessary to fulfill your order, such as name, address, and email address. By providing this information, you implicitly consent to its use for this specific purpose. This aligns with standard practices in online commerce.</p>
        <p>Marketing Communications: We will explicitly seek your consent for purposes beyond order fulfillment, such as sending marketing communications.<br />This can be done in two ways:</p>

            <li>We may provide you with a clear way to opt-out of receiving marketing communications.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent for us to use your information at any time. This applies to both information collected for order fulfillment and marketing purposes. Here&rsquo;s how you can do that:</p>
        <p>Contact Us: Submit a request through our Contact Page. Be sure to specify what information you no longer consent to us using.</p>
